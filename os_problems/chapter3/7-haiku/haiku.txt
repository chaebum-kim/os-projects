“The Old Pond” by Matsuo Bashō
An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pond—
Splash! Silence again.

“A World of Dew” by Kobayashi Issa
A world of dew,
And within every dewdrop
A world of struggle.

“Lighting One Candle” by Yosa Buson
The light of a candle
Is transferred to another candle—
Spring twilight

“A Poppy Blooms” by Katsushika Hokusai
I write, erase, rewrite
Erase again, and then
A poppy blooms.

“Over the Wintry” by Natsume Sōseki
Over the wintry
Forest, winds howl in rage
With no leaves to blow.
